- total_unpaid_5star_reviews were 3035639
- unpaid_5star_reviews_percentage was 62.73%
- paid_5star_reviews_percentage was 44.45%

## Summary

The group of unpaid reviews were significantly larger than paid group and unpaid review group tend to rate 5 stars more often in sports product than paid review group. 
It is hard to determine the unpaid or paid are biased since the data set doesn't provide variables that potentially affect the decision of purchasing. 
We could break down why unpaid group rated higher than paid group through qualitative data collection to see which factors affect the result.
